# PieLang
Pie language, interpreted, easy to learn, and has a similar C++ & Ruby syntax.

# Warning
Pie is still under development so you *will* encounter bugs. 
This is also my first *official* language that I have ever made!

# An example syntax
```cpp

out "Hello, world";
name = "Elipie":
for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  out i;
}
```
