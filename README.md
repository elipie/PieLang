# PieLang
Pie language, interpreted, easy to learn, and has a similar C++ & Ruby syntax.


# Warning
Pie is still under development so you *will* encounter bugs. 
This is also my first *official* language that I have ever made!

# About
My last name *piechocki* starts with **Pie**. So, I decided to turn everything around in my life to *pie*. Pie is yummy, and has a ring to it(i think lol). So then came along the age of language development. I decided to learn C++ and create a language called *Pie*. This is a fun excersise that helps me grow my knowledge of C++! I hope people can use Pie all around the world!



# An example syntax
```cpp

out "Hello, world";
name = "Elipie";

for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  out i;
}
do{
  i = 10;
  i --;
}while(i > 0);
array<2> = ["pie", "good"];
// control flow
pie = "gud";
if(pie == "gud"){
  out "yes.";
}elsif(pie != "gud"){
  out "no";
}else {
  out "Pie good";
}
func add(a,b) -> i32{
  @ a + b;
 }
 add(1,2);
 
```
